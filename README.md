This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project for the Asia Cup cricket tournament (1980–2023), built using Power BI. The project explores key aspects of team and player performance, tournament history, and future predictions through interactive dashboards. Key insights include winning probability analysis, team and player statistics, host country selection based on historical data, and ticket price prediction. The dashboard also implements Row-Level Security (RLS) for data access control and Natural Language Query (Q&A) for interactive insights.

This project leverages Power BI’s advanced features, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations to provide valuable insights for cricket analysts, tournament organizers, sponsors, and fans. The repository includes the Power BI PBIX file, a detailed report document, and raw data files used for analysis. Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance this project further!![Picture1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f087e19-a070-4202-aa03-55390732a01e)
